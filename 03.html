    <h1>Missional Life - Marking Out Your Story</h1>

    </h2>

    <p>Marking out your story is helpful for two main points:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understanding God's work in your life</li>
        <li>Telling others about God through your story</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For the first point, we used the following worksheet to go through our own lives to see how God has and is and will continue to work in our lives.</p>

    </p>

    <p><strong>Marking out our story glorifies God:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thoughtful, intentional, honest reflection</li>
        <li>Where we used to be</li>
        <li>Where we are now</li>
        <li>Don't want to forget the goodness of God in our lives</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One example of God's faithfulness can be found in Exodus. God saved the Israelites out of slavery, but in the wilderness, they forgot God and abandoned Him. Despite their many failures and rejection of God, He had mercy, provided for them, and led them to the Promised Land.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>"Genesis was written anonymously, but both Jewish and Christian religious tradition attributes the entire Pentateuchâ€”Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomyâ€”to Moses."</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Marking out your story points you back to the ultimate truth: the story is about God.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The God of the universe is worth knowing.</li>
        <li>He reveals Himself to us in His work and in His Word.</li>
        <li>The more we know of Him, the more we are irresistibly drawn to Him.</li>
    </ul>
