        <li>engaging in fellowship with our Creator</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why should we pray?</h3>
    <blockquote><strong>
        ""Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"" And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment."" <cite>Matthew 22:36-38</cite></strong>
