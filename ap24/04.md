Have FAITH:
- Faithful: prepared & eager to participate, keeping your word (do what you say you're going to do)
- Available: having the time, energy, and resources to commit to discipleship and being willing to step outside of your comfort zone 
  - "Your ability will not help if you do not give your availability." -Saji Ijiyemi, "Don't Die Sitting"
- Intentional: 
- Teachable: 
  - "Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it's not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives."
Carol Dweck, "Mindset- The Psychology of Success"
- Heart after God:
