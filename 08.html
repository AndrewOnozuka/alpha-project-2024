    <p>This talk was a preface to our time evangelizing at the Temecula Mall. It helped us set a framework and tangible goals to accomplish during our time EV-ing.</p>

    <h3>Why?</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>18</sup>And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. <sup>19</sup>Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <sup>20</sup>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”</i>
        <strong><cite>Matthew 28:18-20</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>God calls us to be His laborers.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>37</sup>Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; <sup>38</sup>therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”</i>
        <strong><cite>Matthew 9:37-38</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We should have compassion for those who have never heard the Gospel.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."</i>
        <strong><cite>Matthew 9:36</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>How?</h3>

    </div>

    <p><strong>God's Design:</strong> We were created in God's image and in perfect relationship with Him. We were designed to worship and walk with God, and it was <u>very good</u>.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."</i>
        <strong><cite>Genesis 1:31</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Sin:</strong> Sin entered the world and the perfect relationship between man and God was broken.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"For the wages of sin is death,"</i>
        <strong><cite>Romans 6:23a</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Brokenness:</strong> Sin leads us to a place of brokenness. Brokenness leads us to realize our need for something greater.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,"</i>
        <strong><cite>Romans 3:23</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Gospel:</strong> Because of His love for us, God sent His son Jesus to live a perfect life, never sinning, and to do what we could not—reconciling us to God.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."</i>
        <strong><cite>Romans 6:23</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Repent:</strong> Acknowledging and turning from our sin.</p>
    <p><strong>Believe:</strong> Trusting that God is who He says He is. By repenting and believing, we receive new life in Jesus and God turns our lives in a new direction.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."</i>
        <strong><cite>Romans 10:9</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>8</sup>For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, <sup>9</sup>not a result of works, so that no one may boast.</i>
        <strong><cite>Ephesians 2:8-9</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Recover & Pursue:</strong> Because of our faith in Jesus, we can return to God’s original design for our lives—to worship Him and walk with Him.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come."</i>
        <strong><cite>2 Corinthians 5:17</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure."</i>
        <strong><cite>Philippians 2:13</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We defined a win as initiating **two conversations** and asking **one spiritual question** before heading to the Promenade Mall!</p>
