# Communal Life - Gospel Waltz
## Alpha Project Session #6: Elsa Kim

What is the Gospel Waltz?
- a <u>tool</u> that gives us framework for <u>transformation</u>
- helps answer the question:
  - How do I <u>grow</u> as a disciple of Jesus?

## Repent
**"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9**
- What sin do I need to confess and repent of?
- What is the sin beneath my sin?
- Why do I love to disobey in this area?
- How is this offensive to God?
- How have I grieved the Holy Spirit?

**Identifying more of our sin should make us more desperate for Christ!**

## Believe

## Obey
