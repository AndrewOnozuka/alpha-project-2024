    <ol>
        <li><strong>What</strong> is prayer?</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong> should we pray?</li>
        <li><strong>How</strong> to pray (ACTS method)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prayer is:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Communication with God</li>
        <li>Not just talking to Him, but also with Him</li>
        <li>Engaging in fellowship with our Creator</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why should we pray?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>36</sup>‚ÄúTeacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?‚Äù <sup>37</sup>And he said to him, ‚ÄúYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. <sup>38</sup>This is the great and first commandment.‚Äù</i>
        <strong><cite>Matthew 22:36-38</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>The greatest commandment is to love God</li>
        <li>Prayer is a way to develop an intimate relationship with God</li>
    </ul>

    <p><u>Jesus prayed all the time during His life on earth!</u></p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"But he would withdraw to desolate places and pray."</i>
        <strong><cite>Luke 5:16</cite></strong><br>
        <i>"And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed."</i>
        <strong><cite>Mark 1:35</cite></strong><br>
        <i>"In these days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God."</i>
        <strong><cite>Luke 6:12</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Prayer Method: ACTS (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Supplication)</h2>

    <h3>1. Adoration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Adore: worship as divine; love or revere deeply</li>
        <li>Praising God for who He is</li>
        <li>
            <i>"Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name."</i>
            <strong><cite>Hebrews 13:15</cite></strong>
        </li>
        <li>‚ÄúAdoration is the spontaneous yearning of the heart to worship, honor, magnify, and bless God‚Ä¶ In the prayer of adoration we love God for himself, for his very being, for his radiant joy.‚Äù <cite>Richard Foster</cite></li>
        <li>Ways to pray prayers of adoration:
            <ul>
                <li>Pray through the Psalms (<strong><cite>Psalm 8, 40, 96, 103, 111, 117, 145</cite></strong>)</li>

        <li>Acknowledging our sins before God</li>
        <li>Allowing light to expel darkness and experiencing God‚Äôs mercy</li>
        <li>
            <i><sup>8</sup>If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. <sup>9</sup>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</i>

            <strong><cite>1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</cite></strong>
