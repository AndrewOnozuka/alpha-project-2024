# Missional Life - Marking Out Your Story
## Alpha Project Session #3: Nathaniel Lightle

Marking out your story is helpful for two main points:
1. Understanding God's work in your life
2. Telling others about God through your story

For the first point, we used the following worksheet to go through our own lives to see how God has and is and will continue to work in our lives.

Marking out our story glorifies God:
- thoughtful, intentional, honest reflection
- where we used to be
- where we are now
- don't want to forget to goodness of God in our lives

One example of God's faithfulness can be found in Exodus
